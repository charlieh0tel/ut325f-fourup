Supports running four Uni-T UT325F 4-channel temperature meters simultaneously.

Each meter should use one thermocouple.  The input position for each
meter determines the column used in the CSV file.  The positions must
be unique.   The port order does not matter.

(These are four channel meters but the inputs are not galvanically isolated.)
